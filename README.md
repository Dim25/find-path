## Path Finding 
### Installation 
TODO

### Training
Go to *calculations* folder.
```bash
$ cd calculations
```
Run training.
```bash
$ python train.py
```
### Run Trained Model
Check for examples in *calculations/demo.py*, *calculations/demo.ipynb*, *calclulations/video_demo.ipynb* files.

## Dataset Maker
For making dataset, web based application was made which uses just JavaScript without any framework.

### Installation
Before installation, make sure that NodeJS, npm and bower are installed.
```bash
$ cd dataset_maker
$ bower install
```

### Launching
Open *index.html* and have fun.

## Dataset
All dataset images have 320 width, 180 height and contain 3 channels. Every image has own *.json* file which describes object in the image. In this project only 3 classes are observed: **boundaries** (everything arround path), **paths / ways** and **obstacles** (things that are on path - eg. human, road pit and etc.). Dataset contains 300 images (I'll put a bit later).

## Path Finding with OpenCV
Check *calculations/cv/* folder.
